# Experiment Log Template

Use this folder to track calibration sessions, field tests, and benchmarking runs. Start a new Markdown file for each session (e.g., `2024-05-18-trackday.md`) using the template below and drop inline photos wherever they help illustrate the story.

```markdown
# Experiment Title (Date)

## Objectives
- What are you testing or validating?

## Setup
- Location, environmental conditions, hardware configuration
- Relevant firmware/software versions
- Supporting visuals: ![caption](../../assets/photos/Testing%20build.jpg)

## Procedure
1. Step-by-step actions taken during the session
2. Embed progress shots or RViz screenshots as needed

## Results
- Key metrics (tables/plots)
- Links to supporting media: photos (`../../assets/photos/...`) and videos (`../../assets/videos/...`)
- Inline figures for quick reference (for example, ![LiDAR/ZED comparison](../../assets/photos/Lidar_ZED_Distance.png))

## Lessons Learned
- What worked, what needs improvement, next actions
```

Maintaining detailed experiment notes—complete with photos—helps future students reproduce results and build on your progress.
