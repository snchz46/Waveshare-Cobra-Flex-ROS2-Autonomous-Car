# Experiment Log Template

Use this folder to track calibration sessions, field tests, and benchmarking runs. Start a new Markdown file for each session (e.g., `2024-05-18-trackday.md`) using the template below:

```markdown
# Experiment Title (Date)

## Objectives
- What are you testing or validating?

## Setup
- Location, environmental conditions, hardware configuration
- Relevant firmware/software versions

## Procedure
1. Step-by-step actions taken during the session

## Results
- Key metrics (tables/plots)
- Links to supporting media: photos (`../../assets/photos/...`) and videos (`../../assets/videos/...`)

## Lessons Learned
- What worked, what needs improvement, next actions
```

Maintaining detailed experiment notes helps future students reproduce results and build on your progress.
