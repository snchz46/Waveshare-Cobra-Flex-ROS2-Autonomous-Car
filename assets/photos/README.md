# Photo Gallery

Store high-resolution build photos and documentation shots in this folder. Use the following guidelines to keep the gallery organized:

- Create subfolders per major milestone or experiment (e.g., `2024-setup/`, `calibration-day1/`).
- Include a short `notes.md` in each subfolder summarizing what the images depict and the context for future builders.
- Reference images from the root `README.md` or other docs using relative paths (e.g., `![LiDAR Mount](../assets/photos/2024-setup/lidar-mount.jpg)`).

> Tip: Optimize photos for web viewing (1920px max width) so they can be shared easily without bloating the repository size.

## Current albums

- `2024-05-build-prototype/` – Bench-top shots of the in-progress Cobra Flex build while validating wiring and component placement.
- `2024-05-script-debug/` – Screenshot(s) capturing ROS 2 script output used during development.
- `2024-05-hardware-comparison/` – Visual reference comparing hardware or chassis configurations.

Each album contains a `notes.md` file summarizing the available context and placeholders for future annotations. Update these notes as more detailed observations are recorded.
