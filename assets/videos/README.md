# Video Library

Use this directory to track demo footage, drive tests, and experiment walk-throughs.

- Store raw clips in subfolders per recording session (e.g., `2024-05-setup/`, `obstacle-avoidance-test/`).
- Add a `clips.csv` or `session-notes.md` with timestamps, highlights, and links to any hosted versions (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).
- When possible, export lightweight preview GIFs or MP4 clips (under 20 MB) so they can be shared directly from the repository.

Document key results in `docs/media-log.md` or the experiment logs so viewers know which clip corresponds to each milestone.
