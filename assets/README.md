# Assets Overview

This folder collects all project media and models so documentation and demos stay portable inside the repository. Use the subfolders to keep contributions organized:

- [`photos/`](photos/): High-resolution build shots, wiring references, and RViz overlays. Add captions in the local `README.md` and embed images into docs via relative links.
- [`videos/`](videos/): Drive tests and demo footage. Create a short note per recording session with timestamps and hosted mirrors when available.
- [`3d-models/`](3d-models/): STL, STEP, IPT, and other CAD artifacts for the Cobra Flex chassis. Pair each new model with print/orientation notes in the subfolder README.

Keep filenames web friendly, prefer subfolders for large drops (for example, `2024-07-trackday/`), and update `docs/media-log.md` when adding notable media so readers can find the latest visuals.
