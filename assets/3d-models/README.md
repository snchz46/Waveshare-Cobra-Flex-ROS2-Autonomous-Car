# 3D Models for Sensor Mounts

This directory is reserved for STL, STEP, and other 3D model files that support
mounting sensors and accessories to the Cobra Flex chassis.

Suggested organization:

- `sensors/` – individual sensor mounting adapters (e.g., camera mounts,
  LiDAR brackets).
- `chassis/` – platform-wide mounting plates or body panels that integrate with
  the Cobra Flex frame.
- `prototypes/` – work-in-progress designs or experimental components.

Feel free to add additional subdirectories as needed to keep custom designs
organized. Include a short README with each new design that explains the sensor
or component it supports, print settings, and mounting hardware requirements.
